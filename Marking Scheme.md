First Case : All test Cases passed

Second Case : Compiled, but not All Test Case passed
    - Check Functional Correctness (Logical Correctness)
        - Total marks is 30 : then, for functional correctness it will be 12.
        - If the Total Marks is 20 : then, for functional correctness it will be 8.

    - Check Syntax Correctness
        - If the Functional Correctness passes, then Check for Syntax error.
        - If Total marks is 30 : then, for Syntax correctness we will award : 6.
        - If the Total Marks is 20 : then, for Syntax correctness it will be 4.
    

Third Case : Compilation Error

- For pattern, parts of pattern is printed correctly.
- Half marks, If the linked list creating process is right
- Half marks, for the desired function
- For Array question directly check for function correctness
