Please help me understand this code, and list all the errors and mistakes in it.
The information regarding the code is as follows :
In the main function, you already have code to create array A  of size n and store the user's input in it. Along with that a pointer of integer type is created. 
Thereafter in the main function, we pass the created array A  and n in the function minarray(int A[], int n) and store the address returned by the function in G.   Your task is to code the function int* minarray(int A[], int n) in f1.c  which returns the address of the array that contains the nearest smaller element A[j] for each element A[i] in the array, where j is an index smaller than i. If there is no such element for A[i], then  -1 is the result for A[i].  
Your code should satisfy the following sample. 
 
Sample 1: 
Enter the size of the array: 5	
Enter the elements of the array: 1 3 2 4 5
The array containing nearest smaller elements: -1 1 1 2 4

Check the logic of finding nearest smaller element for each element.
Further, also check if there are errors in the code.
Are you ready for the code I am going to provide you?
